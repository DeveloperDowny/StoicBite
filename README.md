"A man should always have these two rules in readiness; the one, to do only whatever the reason of the ruling and legislating faculty may suggest for the use of men; the other, to change thy opinion, if there is anyone at hand who sets thee right and moves thee from any opinion." --Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, Book 4

Reflect upon these words, my pupil, and integrate them into your daily practice. In doing so, you will grow not only as a thinker and leader but as a benevolent and wise individual.

Until our next teaching, carry these thoughts with you.

Yours in wisdom,
Marcus Aurelius
